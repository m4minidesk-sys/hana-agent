# 結（Yui）Slack App Manifest
# Usage: https://api.slack.com/apps → "Create New App" → "From an app manifest" → Paste this
#
# This manifest configures Yui as a Socket Mode bot.
# After creating the app, you need to:
#   1. Generate an App-Level Token (Basic Information → App-Level Tokens → connections:write)
#   2. Install to Workspace (OAuth & Permissions → Install to Workspace)
#   3. Copy both tokens to ~/.yui/.env
